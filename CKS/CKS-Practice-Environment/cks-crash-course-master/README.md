# Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS) Crash Course

Vulnerabilities in software and IT infrastructure, once exploited, can pose a major threat to organizations. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) developed the [Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS) certification](https://www.cncf.io/certification/cks/) to verify a Kubernetes administrator’s proficiency to protect a Kubernetes cluster and the cloud-native software operated in it. The exam is different from the typical multi-choice format of other certifications. It’s completely performance-based and requires deep knowledge of the tasks at hand under immense time pressure. Are you ready to pass the test on the first go?

This practical course is designed to walk you through all the topics covered in the exam to fully prepare to pass the certification exam. The trainer, [CKA](https://www.credly.com/badges/9a599e63-6155-422e-b169-8eaaed5369ab) and [CKAD](https://www.credly.com/badges/98ba0895-b669-47d5-8206-50b7223940e3), Benjamin Muschko, will also share his personal experience with preparing for all aspects of the exam.
